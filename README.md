# Metacritic-Inspired Game Rating Site with Multi-Platform Support and Moderation
This project aimed to recreate a platform similar to **Metacritic**, focusing on **game reviews**. The site allows users to review games, rate existing reviews, and manage their profiles. There are three types of users: **regular users**, who can post and evaluate reviews; **critics**, who have their own section for expert reviews; and **administrators**, responsible for managing game data and moderating content. Each game can be rated across different platforms, offering a versatile rating system, and users can interact by liking reviews. The goal was to develop a comprehensive game review site with a user-friendly experience.
